# Library & Playlist Files Attributes

## Library Attributes

Within the [Configuration File](configuration), the `libraries:` attribute specifies the Plex libraries that the user wants Plex Meta Manager to act on.

Attributes are used to instruct Plex Meta Manager what actions to take, such as "load the following libraries" or "execute the following Collection Definition files". These attributes can be specified individually per library, or can be inherited from the global value if it has been set. If an attribute is specified at both the library and global level, then the library level attribute will take priority.

### Example

This example is an advanced version of the library mappings which highlights some attributes being set at the global level, and some being set at the library level:

  <br />

In this example, the `"TV Shows On Second Plex"` library has a library-level `plex` configuration, which takes priority over the `plex` configuration set at the global level. <br>

The `"Anime"` library also has a library-level `radarr` configuration, which takes priority over the `radarr` configuration set at the global level.

### Attributes

The available attributes for each library are as follows:

### Library Name

Each library that the user wants Plex Meta Manager to interact with must be documented with a library attribute. A library attribute is represented by the mapping name (i.e. `Movies` or `TV Shows`), this must have a unique name that correlates with a library of the same name within the Plex Media Server. In the situation that two servers are being connected to which both have libraries of the same name, the `library_name` attribute can be utilized to specify the real Library Name, whilst the library attribute's mapping name can be made into a placeholder. This is showcased below:
<details>
  <summary>Click to Expand</summary>
  <br />

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies01:
    library_name: Movies
  Movies02:
    library_name: Movies
    plex:
      url: http://192.168.1.35:32400
      token: ####################
  TV Shows:
  Anime:
plex:
  url: http://192.168.1.12:32400
  token: ####################
```

* In this example, `"Movies01"`, `"TV Shows"`, and `"Anime"` will all use the global plex server (http://192.168.1.12:32400) which is defined using the global `plex` mapping. `"Movies02"` will use the plex server http://192.168.1.35:32400 which is defined under its `plex` mapping over the global mapping.
</details>

### Metadata Path

The `metadata_path` attribute is used to define [Metadata Files](../metadata/metadata) by specifying the path type and path of the files that will be executed against the parent library. See [Path Types](paths) for how to define them. 

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
      - git: meisnate12/ShowCharts
      - git: meisnate12/Networks
```

By default, when `metadata_path` is missing the script will look within the root PMM directory for a metadata file called `<MAPPING_NAME>.yml`. In this example, Plex Meta Manager will look for a file named `TV Shows.yml`.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
```

### Overlay Path

The `overlay_path` attribute is used to define [Overlay Files](../metadata/metadata) by specifying the path type and path of the files that will be executed against the parent library. See [Path Types](paths) for how to define them. 

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
    overlay_path:
      - file: config/Overlays.yml
```

#### Remove Overlays

You can remove overlays from a library by adding `remove_overlays: true` to `overlay_path`. This will remove all overlays when run and not generate new ones.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
    overlay_path:
      - remove_overlays: true
      - file: config/Overlays.yml
```

#### Reapply Overlays 

You can reapply overlays from a library by adding `reapply_overlays: true` to `overlay_path`. This will reapply overlays to every item in your library.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
    overlay_path:
      - reapply_overlays: true
      - file: config/Overlays.yml
```

#### Reset Overlays 

You can reset overlays from a library by adding `reset_overlays` to `overlay_path` and setting it to either `tmdb` or `plex` depending on where you want to source the images from. This will use the reset image when overlaying items in your library.

```yaml
libraries:
  TV Shows:
    metadata_path:
      - file: config/TV Shows.yml
    overlay_path:
      - reset_overlays: plex
      - file: config/Overlays.yml
```

### Report Path

The `report_path` attribute is used to define where to save the YAML Report file. This file is used to store information about what media is added, removed, filtered, and missing from the Plex library compared to what is expected from the Metadata file.

If your Metadata file creates a collection with `Movie 1`, `Movie 2` and `Movie 3` but your Plex library only has `Movie 1` and `Movie 3`, then the missing YAML file will be updated to inform the user that `Movie 2` was missing from the library.

The default and recommended path is `/config/<<MAPPING_NAME>>report.yml` where `<<MAPPING_NAME>>` is the name of the library attribute, as showcased below:

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies:
    report_path: /config/Movies_report.yml
```

Alternatively, Report YAML files can be placed in their own directory, as below:

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies:
    report_path: /config/reports/Movies.yml
```

### Template Variables

Library template variables to be applied to every Metadata and Overlay file run.

```yaml
libraries:
  Movies:
    template_variables:
      collection_mode: true
```

## Playlist Files Attribute

As playlists are not tied to one specific library and can combine media from multiple libraries, they require their own special [Playlist Files](../metadata/metadata) to work.

You can define Playlist Files by using `playlist_files` mapper by specifying the path type and path of the files that will be executed. See [Path Types](paths) for how to define them.

```yaml
playlist_files:
  - file: config/playlists.yml       
  - git: meisnate12/Playlists
```
